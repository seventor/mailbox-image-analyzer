I want to create an app that analyses images taken from a camera inside a mailbox.
The app should consist of several parts:
- A simple webapp that shown the images taken
- Lamdbda functions that handles images stored in a S3

# General
- When I ask a question, do not just chnage code. Just answer the question, and then maybe ask if you should change files and code

# CDK and AWS
- All files realted to CDK ans AWS deployment should reside in the subdirectory named 'cdk'
- Do not run AWS CLI commands or CDK Deployments before asking

# Webapp
- All files that are part of the webapp should reside in the subdirectory 'webapp'.
- This subdirectory will contain all html, css, javascript and be uploaded to the S3 bucket.
